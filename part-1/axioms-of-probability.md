# Axioms of Probability

Basic truths about probabilities, considered to be the foundation of probability theory

> [!NOTE]  
> **Kolmogorov Axioms**  
> **Axiom 1: 0 $\leq$ P(E) $\leq$ 1** All probabilities are numbers between 0 and 1    
> **Axiom 2: P(S) = 1** All outcomes must be from sample space  
> **Axiom 3: If E and F are mutually exclusive then P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F)**

> [!NOTE]  
> **Provable Identitites** (corollaries from the three above axioms)  
> **Identity 1: P(E^c) = 1 - P(E)** The probability of the event not happening  
> **Identity 2: If E is a subset of F, then P(E) $\leq$ P(F)** Events which are subsets
