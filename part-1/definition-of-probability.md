# Definition of Probability

We need to consider two sets:  
Sample Space **S** = the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment  
* Coin flip: S = {Heads, Tails}
* Roll of six sided die = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  

Event **E** = a subset of **S** that we consider to be our event
* Coin flip is heads = {Heads}
* Roll of die is 3 or less = {1, 2, 3}

Events can be represented by capital letters such as E or F.

> [!NOTE]  
> Proper definition of probability
> ```math
> P(E) = \lim_{n \to \infty} count(Event) / n
> ```

P(E) is the measure of the chance of E occuring.   
And as n or the number of trials approaches infinity, the ratio will converge to the true probability.
